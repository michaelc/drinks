## Boulevardier

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/boulevardier/

> Loosely translated, a boulevardier is a man-about-town. A cocktail by the same name was created by Erskine Gwynne, the American-born publisher of “Boulevardier," a magazine for expats living in Paris during the 1920s. The drink was popularized after it was included in Harry MacElhone's 1927 book "Barflies and Cocktails." In it, the author credited the cocktail to Gwynne, a regular at Harry's New York Bar in Paris.

I've coined it _**Roma**_ (as in, Italian Manhattan), but this is basically just a whisky _**Negroni.**_

```
* 30ml / 1oz / 2T bourbon/rye
* 30ml / 1oz / 2T sweet vermouth
* 30ml / 1oz / 2T Campari
* Orange twist
* Rocks glass
```

Stir with ice in chilled glass, garnish with orange peel/slice.

## Manhattan

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/manhattan/

> Thought to have been first created around the 1880s, the Manhattan’s exact origins are a bit of a mystery. Many credible records place its creation at New York City’s Manhattan Club. One telling is that the drink originated with a guest of the club, Dr. Iain Marshall; others more dubiously claim that it was first mixed for Lady Randolph Churchill, the mother of Winston Churchill, who records show was not even in the United States at the time. Another story ties the Manhattan’s creation to a bartender named Black, who kept an establishment on Broadway south of Houston Street, though it’s hard to find corroboration on this theory as well.

```
* 60ml / 2oz / 4T rye
* 30ml / 1oz / 2T sweet vermouth
* 2 dashes Angostura
* Orange twist
* Coupe / Nick & Nora glass
```

Stir with ice, strain into chilled glass, dashes, garnish with orange twist (or lemon twist for dry/perfect variations).

### Variations

- Can go from classic `2:1` to stronger (IBA is `2.5:1`) depending on whisky ABV, flavour profile of vermouth, etc.
- _**Dry Manhattan**_  
  Dry vermouth instead of sweet, lemon instead of orange
- _**Perfect Manhattan**_  
  `1:1` sweet/dry vermouth, lemon instead of orange
